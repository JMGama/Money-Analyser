# Money-Analyser :moneybag:

Categorize Mexican bills with visual recognition.

This is just a small **sample** of what would be a larger project in order to help people with **visual disabilities** so that with a mobile device or with specialized hardware they are able to **identify the money** they have and be told by sound, this to facilitate the handling of money.

## How to use it :computer:

To use this project, you will go to the [link to the app](https://moneyanalyser-jmgamest.mybluemix.net/). It would ask you permition to use the webcam, make sure you **allow** it to use your cam.

Then you put a bill in front of the camera an push the **analizar** button.
It will display the answer in the chat balloon of the robot, and also will sound so make sure you **turn on** your volume :sound:.
